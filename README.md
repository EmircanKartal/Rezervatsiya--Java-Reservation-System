# How It Works
## User Interaction
- The reservation system provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to interactively make reservations. It includes functionalities such as selecting travel destinations, choosing dates, and specifying the number of passengers or seats required. The intuitive design ensures that users can easily navigate through the reservation process, providing a seamless and enjoyable experience.

## Data Handling
- Reservation data is efficiently managed through real-time processing. As users input their reservation details, the system dynamically stores and processes this information. The data is organized and updated in the backend, ensuring accuracy and accessibility for subsequent actions, such as payment processing or ticket confirmation.
## Panel Functionality
The system is structured with distinct panels tailored to different user roles:
- **Customer Panel:** Customers can explore available reservations, select travel options, and proceed with booking tickets. The panel offers a user-friendly interface for a smooth reservation experience.

</div>


- **Admin Panel:** Administrators have access to a set of tools that empower them to manage reservations, view customer details, and oversee the overall system functionality. Admin functionalities may include monitoring bookings, resolving issues, and modifying reservation parameters.
- **Company Panel:** Companies involved in the reservation system have specialized panels for managing their services. This may include updating available routes, adjusting pricing, and monitoring the overall performance of their operations.
Each panel is designed to cater to the specific needs and responsibilities of its users, providing a customized and efficient environment for interaction within the reservation system.
